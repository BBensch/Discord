## Public / Private Development
If you are working in a public environment, just typing `npm start` will launch
the 'public' server.  If you are in a private environment, setting the
`IN_PRIVATE` environment variable from your shell will launch the 'private'
server.  On a \*nix shell, this is done by `IN_PRIVATE=asdf npm start`
